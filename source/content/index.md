# Book Study Summer 2025
## Session 0 - Intro and Primer
1. Intro to the book. Heiser is dialoguing with scholars. He's direct, sometimes uncomfortably so. Let the language pass you by, and hold on to the information he's passing along. It will, at times, unmoor you from long-held theological convictions, things we consider orthodoxy. However, he will not leave you adrift. Instead, you might find yourself sailing on towards the west after a long journey:  
	1. And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. And it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise.
2. It is this rolling back that we pursue. A revelation of sorts. What is this new destination? One rooted in ancient cosmology and functional ontology. Let's visit this cosmology and ontology before we dive into the book(s).
### The one about Cosmology and Ontology

#### Ancient Cosmology
What is Cosmology? Cosmology deals with the nature and purpose of the universe. In the modern world, we often split this into two camps: science (what we can observe) and philosophy or theology (what we believe). But this artificial divide creates tension — within Christianity and between Christians and non-Christians alike.

Plato, through the art of _prosopopoeia_, uses Socrates to reframe this not as a dichotomy, but as a spectrum of knowing — what we now call the Analogy of the Divided Line. He begins with imagination (_eikasia_), moves to belief (_pistis_), then to thought (_dianoia_), and finally reaches understanding (_noêsis_). Where the modern mind sees a wall between reason and faith, Plato saw a progression toward what he called _the Good_.

Why bring this up? Science can take us far — up to _dianoia_, the realm of logic, structure, and mathematical precision. But it cannot go beyond that boundary. It is tethered to what can be measured and modeled. As Christians, we live as both body and soul, flesh and spirit — and we are called to inhabit that whole reality, just as Christ did. It is worth noting that The Divided Line is rooted in Ontology, which we will get to, but it has applicability to Cosmology.

So, too, must our cosmology. It must not only account for what _is_, but for what _ought to be_. It must stretch from what is visible to what is ultimate — from stars to Spirit, from gravity to grace.

Let us acknowledge that our cosmology is rooted in what is testable and measurable. We understand it to be gravity, atoms, particle physics, dark matter, photons, and all kinds of new discoveries. However, the ancient authors of the Hebrew Bible were unaware of this. Neither were their neighbors, the Egyptians, the Canaanites, Assyrians, or Babylonians. The ancient world's cosmology starts and ends with the divine. God(s) create a multitude of things and beings for various purposes. How and why they create varies from myth to myth, but it always starts with something, usually water. And aside from the Hebrew god, it usually involves a cocktail of illicit sex, rape, incest, war, murder, and slavery. We have to willfully suspend our scientific cosmological understanding to engage with the ancient world.

### Functional Ontology
We look at what we can test. The biblical authors write about how things should function with an eye toward a Functional Cosmic Temple. Heiser will talk about temple imagery often throughout his book. Walton in TLWoG1 paints a wonderful picture of why this language is functionally oriented.
