## Primer to Unseen Realm
It would be a mistake for me to undertake an endeavor without quoting Tolkien. My hope is that this quote serves as a guide post for our journey through the Unseen Realm of the Hebrew Bible.

"And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. And it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise." - Tolkien "Return of the King"

It is this rolling back that we pursue. A revelation of sorts. What is this new destination? One rooted in ancient cosmology and functional ontology. Let's visit this cosmology and ontology before we dive into the book.
### The one about Cosmology and Ontology

#### Ancient Cosmology
What is Cosmology? Cosmology deals with the nature and purpose of the universe. In the modern world, we have split this into two camps: science (what we can observe) and philosophy or theology (what we believe). Unfortunately, this artificial divide creates tension both within Christianity and between Christians and non-Christians.

Let us acknowledge that our cosmology is rooted in what is testable and measurable, the sciences. We understand it to be gravity, atoms, particle physics, dark matter, photons, and all kinds of new discoveries. However, the ancient authors of the Hebrew Bible were unaware of this, as were their neighbors, the Egyptians, the Canaanites, the Assyrians, and the Babylonians. The ancient world's cosmology starts and ends with the divine. God(s) create a multitude of things and beings for various purposes. How and why they create varies from myth to myth, but it always starts with something, usually water. And aside from the Hebrew god, it usually involves a cocktail of illicit sex, rape, incest, war, murder, and slavery.

Science can take us far, but it has its limits. Plato recognized this, stating that empiricism can only take us to the realm of logic, structure, and mathematical precision. But it cannot transcend to the highest level of reality and truth. Science is tethered to what can be measured and modeled. As Christians, we live as both body and soul, flesh and spirit — and we are called to inhabit the whole of reality, just as Christ did. In order for us to engage with the ancient world, we must willfully suspend our scientific cosmological understanding and wrap ourselves in the mythos of the ancient world. Our cosmology must account not only for what is but also for what ought to be. It must stretch from what is visible to what is unseen — from stars to Spirit, from gravity to grace.

#### Functional Ontology
Like our cosmology, our ontology is also rooted in the scientific. John Walton calls our modern ontological position material ontology. However, in his book The Lost World of Genesis One, he argues that the biblical authors write under the assumption of a functional ontology, ultimately with an eye toward a Functional Cosmic Temple. Heiser will talk about temple imagery throughout his book, often with a nod towards Eden that was and the Eden to come. Walton, in TLWoG1, paints a wonderful picture of why this language is functionally oriented.

Walton stresses that creation days one to three are about God creating functional spaces that will be inhabited by functionaries, the creatures created on days four to six. All of this is to create a functioning temple with divine and human councils who function as God's representatives in and through the cosmos. "The temple is the residence and palace of the gods. Like the American White House, it is the hub of authority and control. It is where the work of running the country takes place. When a newly elected president looks forward to taking up his residence in the White House, it is not simply so he can kick off his shoes and snooze in the Lincoln bedroom. It is so he can begin the work of running the country. Thus, in ancient terms, the president “takes up his rest” in the White House. This is far from relaxation. The turmoil and uncertainty of the election is over, and now he can settle down to the important business at hand." Walton - TLWoG1.

A brief example may help us at this juncture. Let's read about days one and four of creation:

Day One - Genesis 1:2-5 - **2** Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. **3** And God said, “Let there be light!” And there was light. **4** And God saw the light, that it was good, and God caused there to be a separation between the light and between the darkness. **5** And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning, the first day. 

Day Four - Genesis 1:14-19 - **14** And God said, “Let there be lights in the vaulted dome of heaven to separate day from night, and let them be as signs and for appointed times, and for days and years, **15** and they shall be as lights in the vaulted dome of heaven to give light on the earth.” And it was so. **16** And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night, and the stars. **17** And God placed them in the vaulted dome of heaven to give light on the earth **18** and to rule over the day and over the night, and to ⌊separate light from darkness⌋. And God saw that it was good. **19** And there was evening, and there was morning, a fourth day.

On day one, God gives function to darkness and light by calling them night and day. The creation of light and its separation from darkness give us the function of Time. On day four, God speaks lights into existence, and the lights map out the night sky. The stars serve as functionaries, marking seasons, days, weeks, and years. Similarly, the sun and moon are the functionaries responsible for maintaining the function of Time by marking day and night. We could assume that the functionaries mentioned here are anthropomorphized. If we maintained a purely materialistic worldview, then that might be true. We should begin to grasp the similarity between YHWH's "greater light" and Ra or Apollo. They all have the same function.

One final note on the functionaries. Heiser's work is centered on these functionaries serving on God's Divine Council. This might be a foreign idea for us. However, it was a common thought throughout the ancient world, something Heiser will elaborate upon as we read through his book.

#### A Personal Note on Christocentic vs Christotelic
I am relatively convinced that the Hebrew Bible is Christotelic as a whole. There are moments that are Christocentric. I am not convinced that those parts define the whole. I would suggest that those who subscribe to a Christocentric view of the Hebrew Bible suspend their belief. Strict adherence to that view might skew the way in which we engage with the more complicated stories (Genesis 6:1-4).

### What do the white shores and green country under a swift sunrise look like?
We cannot abandon what we know. However, we don't need to harmonize our cosmology with that of the Ancient Near East. We do need to understand it if we want to understand what the authors are trying to tell us about who God is, who he is for, and who he stands against. This new country looks like a clear picture of why Jesus came on his divine rescue plan. One that isn't framed as an escape plan from the endless tortures of Hell or a simplistic derivative of a good and moral life (Simply Christian by NT Wright). We will see just how desperate our situation is, not that our fallenness isn't bad enough, but that our fallen state is entangled with fallen divine beings. Together, we create a divine and human failure that only a divine and human savior can fix.
