Part 2, Chapters 3-9

### Overview


Part 2 is a fresh look at creation and the Garden of Eden. We will be confronted by the Septuagint's "flattening" effect on the Hebrew language. There is a much longer discourse about the contributions and limits of Greek thinking to the Hebrew Bible. That could and should be a separate discussion we can tackle, specifically as it pertains to the New Testament. One of the ways we see this flattening is through the destratification of God's Divine family. The Hebrew Bible employs a multitude of terms to describe divine beings. YHWH Elohim, Bene ha Elohim, Cherubim and Seraphim, and Malakim. With the exception of YHWH Elohim, the other terms are replaced with the Greek word angeloi, with a few exceptions. This has left a large rift between the author's intent when choosing words to describe God's divine family and what we have today.

That said, we have encountered God's Divine and Human family and the first place where they overlap. In N.T. Wright's book "Simply Christian," Tom introduces the idea that Heaven and Earth are meant to overlap, like two dimensions layered one atop the other. It would seem that God and both his families could exist in either place without hindrance. Or perhaps it is better to say that the two spaces were so connected that one could not tell where Earth ended and heaven began. Sin, as we know, is the pollution that prevents God's space from fully overlapping with ours. Thus, when God reintroduces Himself to His people at Sinai, He gives us a list of rights and rituals to purify ourselves and our environment of pollution, making it possible for Him to inhabit our space once again.

It is on rare occasions, only two or four, depending on how one counts, that someone from our side approached God's space. Moses, Elijah, Jesus, and Enoch, the last of which approached because he was taken up to heaven. It is notable that Moses and Elijah meet God face-to-face on a mountain, and then all three are seen together by the disciples on a mountain. However, God is constantly breaking through to our side. Whether it is in a dream, vision, a wrestling match, or the parting of mighty waters, God is always showing up, rescuing us, and providing for us in ways that we never expected. But I digress. These are all points that we should consider as we work through the book.

The main point of this section is that God has two families. Both are reflections (images) of his glory in part, but they and we are not the "radiance of his glory and the representation of his being" as the author of Hebrews describes Jesus. I'll leave us to ponder the remainder of the opening to the Book of Hebrews as we look forward to Genesis 3: 

1 Although God spoke long ago in many parts and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets, 2 in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world, 3 who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, sustaining all things by the word of power. When he had made purification for sins through him, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 having become by so much better than the angels, by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs.
